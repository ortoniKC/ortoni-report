## Using the Ortoni Report CLI

### Command: `show-report`

This command starts a local Express server and serves the generated Ortoni report. You can open the report in your default browser.

#### Options
- **`-d, --dir <path>`**: Path to the folder containing the report. Defaults to `ortoni-report`.
- **`-f, --file <filename>`**: Name of the report file. Defaults to `ortoni-report.html`.
- **`-p, --port <port>`**: Port number for the local server. Defaults to `2004`.

#### Example Usage

1. **Default Usage**
   ```bash
   npx ortoni-report show-report
   ```
   This will:
   - Look for the report file `ortoni-report.html` in the `ortoni-report` folder.
   - Start the server on port `2004`.

2. **Custom folder and file Options**
   ```bash
   npx ortoni-report show-report --dir custom-folder --file my-report.html --port 3000
   ```
   This will:
   - Look for the file `my-report.html` in `custom-folder`.
   - Start the server on port `3000`.

#### Errors and Troubleshooting
- If the specified file or folder does not exist, you will see an error like:
  ```
  Error: The file "my-report.html" does not exist in the folder "custom-folder".
  ```
  Ensure the file and folder paths are correct.

#### Accessing the Report
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:<port>
```

Replace `<port>` with the port number you specified or the default port (`2004`). The report will automatically open in your default browser if the `always` option is enabled.
